The largest population is in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, home to about 84,000 residents, most of whom are American citizens. Ohio, Washington and California also have significant populations.\n\nAlmost 58% of the Somalis in Minnesota were born in the U.S. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority \u2013- 87% \u2014 are naturalized U.S. citizens. Of the foreign-born population, almost half entered the U.S. in 2010 or later, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nThey include many who fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state\u2019s welcoming social programs.\n\n\nTrump targets the community\nTrump has become increasingly focused in recent weeks on Somalis living in the U.S., saying they \u201chave caused a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\nTrump and other administration officials stepped up their criticism after a conservative news outlet, City Journal, claimed that taxpayer dollars from defrauded government programs have flowed to the militant group al-Shabab, an affiliate of al-Qaida that controls parts of rural Somalia and often has targeted the capital, Mogadishu.\n\n\nWhile Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a social media post Monday that his agency is investigating whether \u201chardworking Minnesotans\u2019 tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization,\u201d little evidence has emerged so far to prove a link. Federal prosecutors have not charged any of the dozens of defendants in recent public program fraud cases in Minnesota with providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nLast month, Trump said he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somali migrants in Minnesota, a legal safeguard against deportation. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.\n\nThe announcement drew immediate pushback from some state leaders and immigration experts, who characterized Trump\u2019s declaration as a legally dubious effort to sow fear and suspicion.\n\nFraud allegations lead to pushback\nLocal Somali community leaders, as well as allies like Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have also pushed back against those who might blame the broader Somali community for some recent cases of massive fraud in public programs.\n\nThose include what is known as the Feeding Our Future scandal, which federal prosecutors say was the country\u2019s largest COVID-19-related fraud case. It involved a program meant to feed children during the pandemic. The defendants were accused of fraudulently claiming to be feeding millions of meals to children. While the alleged ringleader was white, many of the defendants were Somalis, and most of them were U.S. citizens.\n\n\nProsecutors in recent months have raised their estimate of the thefts to $300 million from an original $250 million, and the number of defendants last month grew to 78. The cases are still working their way through the court system.\n\nRepublican candidates for governor and other offices in 2026 are staking their hopes on voters blaming Walz for failing to prevent the losses to taxpayers. Trump has blasted Walz for allowing the fraud to unfold on his watch.\n\n\nEarlier terrorism cases still echo\nAuthorities in Minnesota struggled for years to stem the recruiting of young Somali men by the Islamic State group and the Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab.\n\nThe problem first surfaced in 2007, when more than 20 young men went to Somalia, where Ethiopian troops propping up a weak U.N.-backed government were seen by many as foreign invaders.\n\nWhile most of those cases were resolved years ago, another came to light earlier this year. A 23-year-old defendant pleaded guilty in September to attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\nMostly in the 2010s, the Islamic State group also found recruits in Minnesota\u2019s Somali community, with authorities saying roughly a dozen left to join militants in Syria.\n\nSomalis have become a force in Minnesota politics\nThe best-known Somali American is arguably Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a fiery progressive whose district includes Minneapolis and is a frequent target of Trump.\n\nSeveral other Somali Americans have served in the Minnesota Legislature and the Minneapolis and St. Paul city councils. State Sen. Omar Fateh, a democratic socialist, finished second in the Minneapolis mayoral election in November to incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey.", "prediction": "real", "confidence": 1.0, "latency_total": 0.021306991577148438, "latency_inference": 0.020300865173339844, "latency_server": 0.0010061264038085938}

PRICE\nUpdated 1:46 AM \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0646\u062a\u0634+3, December 3, 2025\nComments 116\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With Tuesday\u2019s White House Cabinet meeting chugging past the two-hour mark, President Donald Trump \u2018s eyes fluttered and closed. His budget director busied himself doodling a fluffy cloud. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was lucky enough to speak early, but the title on his nameplate was misspelled.\n\nThe sleepy, and occasionally slipshod, gathering nonetheless ended with a flurry of news. Trump declared that he didn\u2019t want Somalis in the U.S. and Hegseth cited the \u201c fog of war \u201d in defending a follow-up strike on an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean Sea in September.\n\nThe president started things off by noting that it was the last time his Cabinet would gather until 2026. And, though marathon sessions with his top advisers lavishing praise have become a Trump trademark since he returned to the White House, this latest installment felt at times like a holiday break was needed.\n\nTrump offered lengthy opening comments largely rehashing his key previous policy announcements from recent months. He also repeated old grievances, going back to his falsehoods about having won the 2020 election.\n\nRelated Stories\nHegseth cites 'fog of war' in defending follow-on strike on alleged drug boat\nHegseth cites 'fog of war' in defending follow-on strike on alleged drug boat\nUS carries out new strike in Caribbean, killing 3 alleged drug smugglers\nUS carries out new strike in Caribbean, killing 3 alleged drug smugglers\nUS strikes two more alleged drug-carrying boats, this time in the Pacific Ocean\nUS strikes two more alleged drug-carrying boats, this time in the Pacific Ocean\n\u2018Go quickly\u2019\nThe president then gave each Cabinet member a chance to speak, declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go quickly.\u201d That did little to stop most Cabinet members from offering long presentations.\n\nHegseth went first and praised the Trump administration\u2019s move to rename his agency the Department of War \u2014 something that can\u2019t be officially done without an act of Congress. But the nameplate in front of Hegseth labeled him the \u201cssecretary of war,\u201d including a mistaken double \u201cS\u201d that quickly became the source of searing online ridicule.\n\n\nAfter that, as each official took turns speaking, a TV camera trained on Trump showed him struggling to stay alert. The president sat back in his chair with his eyes occasionally drooping and sometimes shutting completely.\n\nTrump\u2019s apparent sleepiness followed his criticism of a recent New York Times story examining his schedule and stamina at age 79. Trump again slammed the Times story early in Tuesday\u2019s meeting and even slipped into the third person to assure all involved that \u201cTrump is sharp.\u201d\n\nAnother indication that things were dragging came from budget director Russell Vought, who was spotted sketching a bucolic scene on White House letterhead.\n\nVought drew mountains framed by pine trees topped by the kind of friendly-seeming clouds that public television legend Bob Ross preferred to crowd his serene landscape paintings with. The budget chief also sketched an arrow underneath his mountain. Where it was supposed to be pointing was not clear.\n\nClashing affordability messaging\nJust as Trump\u2019s admonishments to keep things tight were flouted, some of the Cabinet members also defied the president in their presentations when it came to the issue of affordability.\n\nTrump made a point in his opening remarks to call concerns that Democrats have raised about rising costs a \u201ccon job.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop many of his administration\u2019s top voices from earnestly detailing how they were indeed seeking to reduce prices nationwide.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins talked about economic pressures on farmers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called affordability a \u201ccrisis,\u201d and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner said that hundreds of thousands of Americans becoming first-time homebuyers was an example of how the administration was making strides to achieve greater affordability.\n\nThe final speaker was Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who spoke for several minutes and acknowledged: \u201cI know I\u2019m last, so I wanted to be fast. But there\u2019s a lot to cover.\u201d\n\nAll told, Tuesday\u2019s gathering lasted more than two hours. That fell short of Trump\u2019s Cabinet meeting record: an August marathon that stretched to a whopping three hours and 17 minutes.\n\nStill, even the president acknowledged that the latest meeting was going long. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of time in here,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump wrapped things by taking questions from reporters, but only after jokingly asking, \u201cAfter that, do you WANT to ask any questions?\u201d He also pointed at a journalist holding a boom mic to capture sound from the Cabinet meeting and playfully offered, \u201cHow strong are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been holding that for two hours,\u201d the president continued, drawing laughs from Cabinet members. \u201cThere are very few people who could do that. I\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d\n\nA newsy Q&A\nReporters\u2019 questions shook off the doldrums.\n\nHegseth said he did not see that there were survivors in the water when the second strike on the boat off Venezuela was ordered and launched in early September. He said \u201cthe thing was on fire\u201d and cited the \u201cfog of war\u201d in defending what occurred. He also said he \u201cdidn\u2019t stick around\u201d for the remainder of the Sept. 2 mission following the initial strike.\n\nIn response to a later question, Trump declared he didn\u2019t want Somali immigrants in the U.S., adding that residents of the war-ravaged eastern African country should stay there and try to fix their homeland. He also accused Somalis of being too reliant on U.S. aid programs while offering little to the nation in return.\n\nThat drew applause from his Cabinet, though the questions ended abruptly with journalists soon hustled out of the room. Trump punctuated the conclusion by slapping his hand twice on the table, pushing his chair back, standing up and thumping Hegseth on the shoulder.", "prediction": "real", "confidence": 1.0, "latency_total": 0.023412466049194336, "latency_inference": 0.023412466049194336, "latency_server": 0.0}

And it\u2019s time to unpack Spotify Wrapped.\n\nOn Wednesday, the music streaming giant delivered its annual recap \u2014 giving its hundreds of millions of users worldwide a look at the top songs, artists, podcasts and other audio that filled their ears over the past year (give or take a month and some change).\n\nSpotify isn\u2019t the only platform \u2014 or music streamer \u2014 to roll out a yearly glimpse of data collected from consumers\u2019 online lives. But since its launch about a decade ago, Wrapped has become one of the most anticipated. And Spotify is billing the 2025 edition to be its biggest yet, with a host of new features it hopes may address some disappointments users had last year.\n\nSo, what goes into pulling together Wrapped, and what\u2019s new this year? Here\u2019s what to know.\n\nHow much of the year does Spotify Wrapped cover?\nTo compile Wrapped, Spotify collects listening data from Jan. 1 through around mid-November.\n\nThat gives the company time to solidify finishing touches and deliver its recap to users by early December. But it also means your late November and December streaming habits won\u2019t be included, which may be why your favorite holiday songs aren\u2019t on the list, or other year-end hits.\n\n\nWhat goes into getting top songs, artists and more?\nFor top songs, artists and \u2014 for the first time this year \u2014 albums to show up on Spotify Wrapped, the platform looks at a mix of what you stream and how long you listen for.\n\nAccording to Spotify, users must listen to at least 30 tracks for over 30 seconds each to get top songs. For artists, users need to listen to at least five unique artists for over 30 seconds. And for top album, users need to have listened to at least 70% of the tracks on one album.\n\nThe company confirmed that data is collected evenly across all platforms \u2014 and that streaming in \u201coffline\u201d mode will also be counted, as long as the device connects back to the internet a few weeks before Wrapped\u2019s launch. Listening using Spotify\u2019s \u201cprivate mode\u201d features, meanwhile, won\u2019t contribute to any rankings, but will still count toward total time spent on the platform. And Spotify says \u201cbackground sounds,\u201d like white noise, are filtered out.\n\nWhen does Spotify start building Wrapped each year? What\u2019s new in 2025?\nMarc Hazan, senior vice president of marketing and partnerships at Spotify, said his team started thinking about 2025 Wrapped the day last year\u2019s recap was launched.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full year production that touches, without question, every function within Spotify,\u201d Hazan told The Associated Press. On day one, he noted, that includes looking at what users think of the Wrapped that just dropped.\n\nMany Spotify subscribers were quick to share disappointments about 2024\u2019s recap \u2014 with some complaining that Wrapped was too minimalist last year. Others took to social media with memes mocking features that didn\u2019t seem to hit the mark.\n\nThe look and feel of Wrapped evolves each year, and Hazan notes the development of the 2025 edition was largely driven by last year\u2019s feedback.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really taken the feedback to heart \u2014 and fueled what we think is the freshest, most action-packed Wrapped experience we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he added.\n\nThat includes returning music genres, which were missing in 2024\u2019s Wrapped. The platform is also introducing top albums and audiobooks, as well as playcounts for each song that makes your annual playlist. And the experience is more gamified this year. There\u2019s a prompt for users to guess their top song before it\u2019s revealed and a \u201clistening age\u201d \u2014 which takes a stab at guessing how old your music taste is, based on when your favorite tunes were released.\n\nSpotify has also unveiled \u201cWrapped Party,\u201d a feature that allows users to compare their listening habits with friends who also use the app \u2014 and win their own award-like titles within the group.\n\n\n\nHow is AI used?\nAmong other backlashes Spotify received last year was speculation over how much artificial intelligence played a role in compiling Wrapped.\n\nThe most visible use of AI in Spotify\u2019s 2024 Wrapped was an accompanying podcast powered by generative AI. Spotify didn\u2019t repeat the podcast this year but is introducing another feature, Archive, which uses a large language model to break down your listening on specific days.\n\nThat\u2019s the most AI-focused part of 2025\u2019s Wrapped, Hazan said. But the technology is still more broadly supplemented across Spotify\u2019s technical operations today, including in scaling the reach of its annual recap.\n\n\u201cRooted into Wrapped is human creativity,\u201d Hazan said, stressing that hundreds of people work on pulling together the recap each year. Technology like AI, he noted, helps \u201cfast track\u201d and \u201cenhance\u201d the product so it can reach the platform\u2019s more than 700 million users.\n\n\n\nWhat does Wrapped say about data tracking more broadly?\nSpotify is far from the only company to track what users do on its platform \u2014 and feed back some of that data, with a nostalgic twist, at the end of the year.\n\nStreaming rival Apple Music rolled out its annual \u201cReplay\u201d on Tuesday. And YouTube this week unveiled its new \u201cRecap,\u201d which similarly breaks down its listeners\u2019 music habits. Social media platforms, Google search and even dictionaries also offer their own year-end reflections.\n\nThese recaps may signal more transparency for users, because they can see some data in their hands. And products like Wrapped have become particularly popular because they\u2019re personalized and now designed to share online \u2014 leaving many to look forward to it as an \u201cannual ritual\u201d of sorts, notes Yakov Bart, a marketing professor at Northeastern University.\n\nStill, one concern is the normalization of now-constant \u201ctracking of digital footprints that consumers leave online,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhat Spotify Wrapped is able to do is essentially package this tracked data into the form of entertainment,\u201d Bart said. \u201cIt reframes all this digital tracking that\u2019s constantly happening behind the scenes into something that\u2019s fun \u2026 And so, instead of kind of feeling under surveillance, users (are) basically feeling seen.\u201d", "prediction": "real", "confidence": 1.0, "latency_total": 0.01592707633972168, "latency_inference": 0.01592707633972168, "latency_server": 0.0}

It has a significant advantage on average qualifying pace - 0.274 seconds over the season, and 0.203secs over the past eight races.\n\nBut wins are split evenly between all three drivers this year - Norris, Verstappen and Piastri all have seven each. The other two grand prix victories have been taken by Mercedes' George Russell.\n\nMcLaren have dominated the constructors' championship, which they clinched at the Singapore Grand Prix on the first weekend in October, with six races remaining.\n\nBut that is a reflection of having two competitive drivers in a consistently race-winning car. No other team has had the luxury of those two factors together.\n\nVerstappen, by contrast, has scored more than 92% of all his team's points this year - team-mate Yuki Tsunoda has been nowhere near him and of no help whatsoever in the Dutchman's title campaign, and has been dropped by Red Bull for next season as a result.\n\nCompetitiveness has ebbed and flowed through the season, and each car has specific strengths.\n\nVerstappen won the Qatar Grand Prix last weekend only because of McLaren's strategy error. Otherwise, that track's long-duration medium- and high-speed corners were perfect McLaren territory.\n\nAbu Dhabi also has some long corners - especially the hairpin on to the first long straight and the long Turn Nine at the end of the second main straight.\n\nBut the McLaren is not at its best in the sort of short-duration, 90-degree corners that comprise the final sector around the marina and hotel, or when braking into chicanes.\n\nAnd the Red Bull has the best straight-line speed.\n\nSo, in terms of track characteristics, the fight looks finely balanced.\n\nMcLaren have taken pole position at the past four races. Over the season, Norris and Verstappen are tied on seven poles each, with Piastri scoring six.\n\nWho has the best history on this track?\nVerstappen has won four times in Abu Dhabi, taking every race victory from 2020-23.\n\nBut his win in 2021 was extremely controversial - that was the title showdown with Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes, where Verstappen won only after the then-race director made up the rules during a late safety-car period.\n\nIt's also not a fair comparison between the three drivers.\n\nFor a start, this is only Piastri's third season in F1. Norris has been in F1 since 2019 and Verstappen since 2015.\n\nBut Norris did not have an even vaguely competitive car until 2023, whereas Verstappen has been winning races on and off since 2016.\n\nAnd Norris was dominant on his way to victory in Abu Dhabi last year.
